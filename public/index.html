# Buffering Example
Why does mixing `fprintf()` and `write()` lead to out-of-order data in the output?
> Explanation: The delay introduced by buffered I/O like `fprintf()` can cause data to be written in a different order compared to `write()`.

- [x] Because of the buffering delay in `fprintf()`
- [ ] Because `write()` is faster
- [ ] Because `fprintf()` only works on files
- [ ] There is no issue


# File Permissions in open()
What is the role of the `mode` parameter in `open()` when using `O_CREAT`?
> Explanation: The `mode` parameter defines the file permissions for a new file created with `O_CREAT`.

- [x] It sets file permissions for a new file
- [ ] It controls buffering
- [ ] It sets the file descriptor
- [ ] It specifies how much data to read


# Reading Fewer Bytes Than Requested
What happens if `read()` reads fewer bytes than requested?
> Explanation: `read()` may read fewer bytes than requested if fewer are available.

- [x] It returns the number of bytes actually read
- [ ] It returns -1 to signal an error
- [ ] It continues reading until all bytes are read
- [ ] It returns 0 to indicate an incomplete read


# Opening a File for Writing

- [x] `char s[10]` allocates memory for 10 characters, `char *s` only allocates space for the pointer
- [ ] Both allocate memory for 10 characters
- [ ] `char *s` allocates more memory than `char s[10]`
- [ ] `char s[10]` does not allocate memory until assigned


# Output of Buffered and Unbuffered Writes

What will the content of the file `out.txt` be after the following C code is executed?

> Explanation: The code mixes buffered (`fprintf`) and unbuffered (`write`) output. The `fflush()` function forces the output buffer to write to the file immediately.

```python
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
    FILE *f = fopen("out.txt", "w");
    int fd = fileno(f);

    fprintf(f, "1\n");
    write(fd, "2\n", 2);

    fflush(f);

    fprintf(f, "3\n");
    write(fd, "4\n", 2);

    fclose(f);
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

- [x] `2\n1\n3\n4\n`
- [ ] `1\n3\n2\n4\n`
- [ ] `1\n2\n4\n3\n`
- [ ] `1234\n`


# Function of fflush()

What is the purpose of the `fflush(f)` statement in the C code?

- [x] It flushes the buffer to ensure data is written immediately
- [ ] It closes the file
- [ ] It opens a new file for reading
- [ ] It clears any errors in the file


# Mixing Buffered and Unbuffered Output

Why does the code use both `fprintf()` and `write()` functions to write to the same file?

> Explanation: `fprintf()` is a buffered I/O function, while `write()` is unbuffered. Mixing the two requires caution to avoid out-of-order writes, unless `fflush()` is used.

- [x] To demonstrate the difference between buffered and unbuffered output
- [ ] To write different types of data
- [ ] To optimize performance
- [ ] To ensure file closing


# Reading from a File

What is the purpose of the `read()` function in the `show_file()` function?

> Explanation: `read()` reads data from the file descriptor into the buffer and returns the number of bytes read.

```python
result = read(fd, buf + num_read, sizeof(buf) - num_read);
```

- [x] It reads data from a file descriptor into the buffer
- [ ] It writes data to the file descriptor
- [ ] It opens a new file
- [ ] It closes the file descriptor


# Error Handling in File Operations

What happens if `open()` fails to open the file in the `main()` function?

> Explanation: If `open()` returns -1, the program calls the `fatal_error()` function, which prints an error message and exits.

```python
int fdin = open("infile", O_RDONLY, 0);
if (fdin == -1) fatal_error("can't open input file");
```

- [x] The program prints an error message and exits
- [ ] The program prints an error message and continues
- [ ] The program attempts to reopen the file
- [ ] The program closes the file and exits


# File Closing in C

What is the significance of the `close()` function in the `main()` function?

> Explanation: `close()` closes the file descriptor, releasing the resources associated with the file. If it fails, the program calls `fatal_error()`.

```python
int result = close(fdin);
if (result == -1) fatal_error("can't close input file");
```

- [x] It closes the file descriptor and handles any error
- [ ] It reads more data from the file
- [ ] It reopens the file
- [ ] It resets the file pointer

# Opening a File in C

What will happen if the file `infile` does not exist when the following code is executed?

> Explanation: The `open()` function uses the `O_RDONLY | O_CREAT` flags, meaning it will open the file in read-only mode if it exists, or create it if it doesn't.

```python
int fdin = open("infile", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT, 0);
if (fdin == -1) fatal_error("can't open input file");
```

- [x] The file will be created, and the program will continue
- [ ] The program will exit with an error
- [ ] The file will not be created, and the program will continue
- [ ] The program will enter an infinite loop


# Buffer Size in show_file()

What is the maximum number of characters that can be read and printed by the `show_file()` function?

> Explanation: The buffer size is set to 50 characters, which means the function reads at most 50 characters from the file.

```python
char buf[50];
```

- [x] 50
- [ ] 100
- [ ] Unlimited
- [ ] 25


# Handling File Descriptors

Why is the `close()` function necessary at the end of `main()`?

> Explanation: `close()` is used to release the file descriptor and any resources associated with the file. It is good practice to close a file after completing operations on it.

```python
int result = close(fdin);
if (result == -1) fatal_error("can't close input file");
```

- [x] It ensures the file is properly closed and resources are released
- [ ] It flushes the buffer
- [ ] It writes data to the file
- [ ] It reads more data from the file


# File Permissions

What file permissions are assigned when the file `infile` is created by the following `open()` function call?

> Explanation: The `0666` mode grants read and write permissions to the owner, group, and others when the file is created.
> Each permission digit is an octal number (0-7) that translates to binary bits representing read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions: 

> Read (r) = 4
> Write (w) = 2
> Execute (x) = 1.
> By summing these values, you get: 

> 7 (rwx) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 111 in binary
> 6 (rw-) = 4 + 2 + 0 = 110 in binary
> 5 (r-x) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 101 in binary
> 4 (r--) = 4 + 0 + 0 = 100 in binary
> For 0666, the permissions are: 

> Owner: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write
> Group: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write
> Others: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write. 
> So, converting 0666 to binary gives you 110110110, confirming that the read and write bits are set (1) and the execute bit is not set (0) for all categories.

```python
int fdin = open("infile", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT, 0666);
```

- [x] Read and write for owner, group, and others
- [ ] Read and write for owner only
- [ ] Read, write, and execute for all
- [ ] No permissions


# Infinite Loop Protection

How does the `show_file()` function avoid an infinite loop when reading from the file?

> Explanation: The `read()` function returns 0 when the end of the file is reached, causing the loop to break.

```python
if (result == 0) break;
```

- [x] The `read()` function returns 0 at the end of the file
- [ ] The loop exits after 50 characters
- [ ] The file descriptor is closed inside the loop
- [ ] It never exits the loop


# Error Handling in C

What does the program do if an error occurs while reading from the file?

> Explanation: If `read()` returns a negative value (indicating an error), the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and exits the program.

```python
if (result < 0) fatal_error("error reading input file");
```

- [x] It prints an error message and exits
- [ ] It retries reading the file
- [ ] It continues reading and ignores the error
- [ ] It skips over the error and closes the file


# Handling the Write System Call

What is the purpose of the `str_write()` function?

> Explanation: The `str_write()` function repeatedly writes a given string to the file descriptor until all characters have been written, handling potential partial writes.

```python
void str_write(int fd, char *buf, size_t num_chars) {
    ssize_t result;
    size_t num_written = 0;

    for (;;) {
        result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars);
        if (result < 0) fatal_error("error writing output file");
        if (result == 0) break;
        num_written += result;
        num_chars -= result;
    }
}
```

- [x] It writes the string to the file descriptor, handling partial writes
- [ ] It reads data from the file and prints it
- [ ] It appends data to the file without overwriting
- [ ] It closes the file after writing


# Error Handling in Writing to Files

What happens if the `write()` system call fails in the `str_write()` function?

> Explanation: If `write()` returns a negative value, the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and exits the program.

```python
if (result < 0) fatal_error("error writing output file");
```

- [x] The program prints an error message and exits
- [ ] The program retries the write operation
- [ ] The program ignores the error and continues
- [ ] The program closes the file and continues


# Opening a File in Write-Only Mode

What happens if the file `outfile` cannot be opened for writing in the `main()` function?

> Explanation: If `open()` returns -1, indicating that the file could not be opened, the `fatal_error()` function is called to handle the error by printing a message and exiting.

```python
int fdout = open("outfile", O_WRONLY, 0);
if (fdout == -1) fatal_error("can't open output file");
```

- [x] The program prints an error message and exits
- [ ] The program opens the file in read-only mode instead
- [ ] The program continues without writing to the file
- [ ] The program waits for the file to become available


# Opening a File for Writing

What are the permissions assigned to the file `outfile` when it is opened with the following `open()` call?

> Explanation: The `0664` permission mode allows the owner to read and write, and the group to read. Others also have read permissions.

```python
int fdout = open("outfile", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0664);
```

- [x] Owner has read and write, group has read, others have read permissions
- [ ] Owner has read and write, group has write, others have no permissions
- [ ] Owner and group have read and write, others have no permissions
- [ ] Everyone has read and write permissions


# Function of `write()` System Call

What is the role of the `write()` system call inside the `str_write()` function?

> Explanation: The `write()` function attempts to write the specified number of bytes to the file descriptor and returns the number of bytes successfully written.

```python
result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars);
```

- [x] It writes the remaining part of the string to the file and returns the number of bytes written
- [ ] It reads data from the file
- [ ] It closes the file
- [ ] It appends the string to the end of the file


# Handling Partial Writes

Why does the `str_write()` function use a loop to call `write()` repeatedly?

> Explanation: The `write()` system call may write fewer bytes than requested, so the loop ensures that all the data is written by repeatedly calling `write()` with the remaining data.

```python
for (;;) {
    result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars);
    if (result < 0) fatal_error("error writing output file");
    if (result == 0) break;
    num_written += result;
    num_chars -= result;
}
```

- [x] To ensure that all bytes are written, handling partial writes
- [ ] To retry writing the file on failure
- [ ] To keep reading data from the file
- [ ] To check if the file is writable


# Truncating a File

What does the `O_TRUNC` flag do in the `open()` system call?

> Explanation: The `O_TRUNC` flag truncates the file, which means it clears all its content if the file already exists before writing new data.

```python
int fdout = open("outfile", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0664);
```

- [x] It clears the content of the file if it exists
- [ ] It appends new data to the file
- [ ] It prevents the file from being opened if it exists
- [ ] It opens the file in read-only mode


# Error Handling with `write()`

What happens if the `write()` system call fails in the `str_write()` function?

> Explanation: If `write()` returns a negative value, the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and terminates the program.

```python
if (result < 0) fatal_error("error writing output file");
```

- [x] The program prints an error message and exits
- [ ] The program retries writing to the file
- [ ] The program ignores the error and continues
- [ ] The program closes the file and continues


# Handling Partial Writes in C

Why does the `str_write()` function contain a loop for calling `write()`?

> Explanation: The `write()` system call may write fewer bytes than requested, so the loop ensures that all the data is written by calling `write()` repeatedly until the entire string is written.

```python
for (;;) {
    result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars);
    if (result < 0) fatal_error("error writing output file");
    if (result == 0) break;
    num_written += result;
    num_chars -= result;
}
```

- [x] To handle partial writes and ensure all bytes are written
