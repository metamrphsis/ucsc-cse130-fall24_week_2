\u003e Explanation: A pointer points to a single memory address, while an array of fixed size reserves a block of memory. - [x] `char *s` is a pointer, `char s[10]` is an array - [ ] Both are pointers to strings - [ ] `char s[10]` is a pointer, `char *s` is an array - [ ] There is no difference between the two # Reading from a File What does the `read()` function return? \u003e Explanation: The return value of `read()` indicates how many bytes were actually read, or 0 at the end of the file, or -1 in case of an error. - [x] Number of bytes read - [ ] File descriptor - [ ] Total number of bytes in the file - [ ] Always -1 to indicate an error # Buffered vs. Unbuffered I/O Why might combining buffered I/O with unbuffered I/O lead to issues? \u003e Explanation: Buffered and unbuffered I/O can produce out-of-order data when used together, as buffered I/O introduces delays in writing data. - [x] It can lead to out-of-order data - [ ] It uses more memory - [ ] It forces immediate writes to disk - [ ] It disables the use of the buffer # Creating a File Which flag in `open()` is used to create a file if it doesn't exist?

\u003e Explanation: The `unlink()` function is used to delete a file by removing its directory entry. - [x] `unlink()` - [ ] `delete()` - [ ] `close()` - [ ] `creat()` # Opening a File What does the `open()` function return upon success? \u003e Explanation: The `open()` function returns a file descriptor that can be used for subsequent operations. - [x] File descriptor - [ ] File name - [ ] Number of bytes - [ ] Pointer to a buffer # File Descriptor in Write What is the role of the file descriptor in the `write()` function? \u003e Explanation: The file descriptor specifies which file or stream to write data to. - [x] It indicates which file to write to - [ ] It sets the number of bytes to write - [ ] It specifies the buffer location - [ ] It signals the end of the write operation # Buffering in File I/O Why would you use system calls instead of standard I/O functions for file I/O? \u003e Explanation: System calls provide direct control over buffering, allowing fine-grained management of input and output operations. - [x] To control buffering - [ ] To use easier functions - [ ] To avoid using `fopen()` - [ ] To increase performance # Difference Between fopen and open Which is a key difference between `fopen()` and `open()`? \u003e Explanation: `fopen()` is a higher-level function that handles buffering, while `open()` is a system call that does not. - [x] `fopen()` uses buffering, `open()` does not - [ ] `fopen()` can only read files - [ ] `open()` requires less memory - [ ] There is no difference # Returning File Position with lseek What does `lseek()` return? \u003e Explanation: The `lseek()` function returns the new position in the file, or -1 if an error occurs. - [x] New file offset - [ ] File descriptor - [ ] Number of bytes read - [ ] File name # Writing to a File What does the `write()` function return?

\u003e Explanation: Static variables retain their value between function calls, while local variables do not. - [x] Static variables retain their value between function calls - [ ] Local variables are global - [ ] Static variables can only be used once - [ ] There is no difference # Setting File Offset with lseek What does `SEEK_SET` do in `lseek()`? \u003e Explanation: `SEEK_SET` sets the file offset to a specific value from the start of the file. - [x] Sets the file offset from the start of the file - [ ] Sets the file offset from the end of the file - [ ] Resets the file to its initial state - [ ] Reads the file contents # Creating a New File Which system call creates a new file and overwrites an existing one? \u003e Explanation: `creat()` creates a new file, overwriting it if it already exists. - [x] `creat()` - [ ] `write()` - [ ] `open()` - [ ] `delete()` # Detecting EOF with read() How does `read()` signal the end of a file? \u003e Explanation: `read()` returns 0 to indicate the end of the file. - [x] By returning 0 - [ ] By returning -1 - [ ] By returning the file descriptor - [ ] By closing the file # Closing a File What does `close()` return upon successful execution? \u003e Explanation: `close()` returns 0 to indicate successful file closure. - [x] 0 - [ ] 1 - [ ] -1 - [ ] The file descriptor # Buffering Example Why does mixing `fprintf()` and `write()` lead to out-of-order data in the output? \u003e Explanation: The delay introduced by buffered I/O like `fprintf()` can cause data to be written in a different order compared to `write()`. - [x] Because of the buffering delay in `fprintf()` - [ ] Because `write()` is faster - [ ] Because `fprintf()` only works on files - [ ] There is no issue # File Permissions in open() What is the role of the `mode` parameter in `open()` when using `O_CREAT`? \u003e Explanation: The `mode` parameter defines the file permissions for a new file created with `O_CREAT`. - [x] It sets file permissions for a new file - [ ] It controls buffering - [ ] It sets the file descriptor - [ ] It specifies how much data to read # Reading Fewer Bytes Than Requested What happens if `read()` reads fewer bytes than requested? \u003e Explanation: `read()` may read fewer bytes than requested if fewer are available. - [x] It returns the number of bytes actually read - [ ] It returns -1 to signal an error - [ ] It continues reading until all bytes are read - [ ] It returns 0 to indicate an incomplete read # Opening a File for Writing Which flag should be used with `open()` to truncate a file upon opening? \u003e Explanation: The `O_TRUNC` flag truncates a file to zero length when it is opened for writing. - [x] `O_TRUNC` - [ ] `O_CREAT` - [ ] `O_RDWR` - [ ] `O_RDONLY` # Memory Allocation for char Arrays How does the memory allocation differ between `char *s` and `char s[10]`? \u003e Explanation: `char s[10]` allocates a block of 10 bytes, while `char *s` only allocates space for the pointer. - [x] `char s[10]` allocates memory for 10 characters, `char *s` only allocates space for the pointer - [ ] Both allocate memory for 10 characters - [ ] `char *s` allocates more memory than `char s[10]` - [ ] `char s[10]` does not allocate memory until assigned # Output of Buffered and Unbuffered Writes What will the content of the file `out.txt` be after the following C code is executed? \u003e Explanation: The code mixes buffered (`fprintf`) and unbuffered (`write`) output. The `fflush()` function forces the output buffer to write to the file immediately. ```python #include #include #include int main(void) { FILE *f = fopen(\"out.txt\", \"w\"); int fd = fileno(f); fprintf(f, \"1\\n\"); write(fd, \"2\\n\", 2); fflush(f); fprintf(f, \"3\\n\"); write(fd, \"4\\n\", 2); fclose(f); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } ``` - [x] `2\\n1\\n3\\n4\\n` - [ ] `1\\n3\\n2\\n4\\n` - [ ] `1\\n2\\n4\\n3\\n` - [ ] `1234\\n` # Function of fflush() What is the purpose of the `fflush(f)` statement in the C code? \u003e Explanation: `fflush()` is used to flush the output buffer and ensure that all buffered data is written to the file. - [x] It flushes the buffer to ensure data is written immediately - [ ] It closes the file - [ ] It opens a new file for reading - [ ] It clears any errors in the file # Mixing Buffered and Unbuffered Output Why does the code use both `fprintf()` and `write()` functions to write to the same file? \u003e Explanation: `fprintf()` is a buffered I/O function, while `write()` is unbuffered. Mixing the two requires caution to avoid out-of-order writes, unless `fflush()` is used. - [x] To demonstrate the difference between buffered and unbuffered output - [ ] To write different types of data - [ ] To optimize performance - [ ] To ensure file closing # Reading from a File What is the purpose of the `read()` function in the `show_file()` function? \u003e Explanation: `read()` reads data from the file descriptor into the buffer and returns the number of bytes read. ```python result = read(fd, buf + num_read, sizeof(buf) - num_read); ``` - [x] It reads data from a file descriptor into the buffer - [ ] It writes data to the file descriptor - [ ] It opens a new file - [ ] It closes the file descriptor # Error Handling in File Operations What happens if `open()` fails to open the file in the `main()` function? \u003e Explanation: If `open()` returns -1, the program calls the `fatal_error()` function, which prints an error message and exits. ```python int fdin = open(\"infile\", O_RDONLY, 0); if (fdin == -1) fatal_error(\"can't open input file\"); ``` - [x] The program prints an error message and exits - [ ] The program prints an error message and continues - [ ] The program attempts to reopen the file - [ ] The program closes the file and exits # File Closing in C What is the significance of the `close()` function in the `main()` function? \u003e Explanation: `close()` closes the file descriptor, releasing the resources associated with the file. If it fails, the program calls `fatal_error()`. ```python int result = close(fdin); if (result == -1) fatal_error(\"can't close input file\"); ``` - [x] It closes the file descriptor and handles any error - [ ] It reads more data from the file - [ ] It reopens the file - [ ] It resets the file pointer # Opening a File in C What will happen if the file `infile` does not exist when the following code is executed? \u003e Explanation: The `open()` function uses the `O_RDONLY | O_CREAT` flags, meaning it will open the file in read-only mode if it exists, or create it if it doesn't. ```python int fdin = open(\"infile\", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT, 0); if (fdin == -1) fatal_error(\"can't open input file\"); ``` - [x] The file will be created, and the program will continue - [ ] The program will exit with an error - [ ] The file will not be created, and the program will continue - [ ] The program will enter an infinite loop # Buffer Size in show_file() What is the maximum number of characters that can be read and printed by the `show_file()` function? \u003e Explanation: The buffer size is set to 50 characters, which means the function reads at most 50 characters from the file. ```python char buf[50]; ``` - [x] 50 - [ ] 100 - [ ] Unlimited - [ ] 25 # Handling File Descriptors Why is the `close()` function necessary at the end of `main()`? \u003e Explanation: `close()` is used to release the file descriptor and any resources associated with the file. It is good practice to close a file after completing operations on it. ```python int result = close(fdin); if (result == -1) fatal_error(\"can't close input file\"); ``` - [x] It ensures the file is properly closed and resources are released - [ ] It flushes the buffer - [ ] It writes data to the file - [ ] It reads more data from the file # File Permissions What file permissions are assigned when the file `infile` is created by the following `open()` function call? \u003e Explanation: The `0666` mode grants read and write permissions to the owner, group, and others when the file is created. \u003e Each permission digit is an octal number (0-7) that translates to binary bits representing read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions: \u003e Read (r) = 4 \u003e Write (w) = 2 \u003e Execute (x) = 1. \u003e By summing these values, you get: \u003e 7 (rwx) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 111 in binary \u003e 6 (rw-) = 4 + 2 + 0 = 110 in binary \u003e 5 (r-x) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 101 in binary \u003e 4 (r--) = 4 + 0 + 0 = 100 in binary \u003e For 0666, the permissions are: \u003e Owner: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write \u003e Group: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write \u003e Others: 6 (110 in binary) — read and write. \u003e So, converting 0666 to binary gives you 110110110, confirming that the read and write bits are set (1) and the execute bit is not set (0) for all categories. ```python int fdin = open(\"infile\", O_RDONLY | O_CREAT, 0666); ``` - [x] Read and write for owner, group, and others - [ ] Read and write for owner only - [ ] Read, write, and execute for all - [ ] No permissions # Infinite Loop Protection How does the `show_file()` function avoid an infinite loop when reading from the file? \u003e Explanation: The `read()` function returns 0 when the end of the file is reached, causing the loop to break. ```python if (result == 0) break; ``` - [x] The `read()` function returns 0 at the end of the file - [ ] The loop exits after 50 characters - [ ] The file descriptor is closed inside the loop - [ ] It never exits the loop # Error Handling in C What does the program do if an error occurs while reading from the file? \u003e Explanation: If `read()` returns a negative value (indicating an error), the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and exits the program. ```python if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error reading input file\"); ``` - [x] It prints an error message and exits - [ ] It retries reading the file - [ ] It continues reading and ignores the error - [ ] It skips over the error and closes the file # Handling the Write System Call What is the purpose of the `str_write()` function? \u003e Explanation: The `str_write()` function repeatedly writes a given string to the file descriptor until all characters have been written, handling potential partial writes. ```python void str_write(int fd, char *buf, size_t num_chars) { ssize_t result; size_t num_written = 0; for (;;) { result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars); if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error writing output file\"); if (result == 0) break; num_written += result; num_chars -= result; } } ``` - [x] It writes the string to the file descriptor, handling partial writes - [ ] It reads data from the file and prints it - [ ] It appends data to the file without overwriting - [ ] It closes the file after writing # Error Handling in Writing to Files What happens if the `write()` system call fails in the `str_write()` function? \u003e Explanation: If `write()` returns a negative value, the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and exits the program. ```python if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error writing output file\"); ``` - [x] The program prints an error message and exits - [ ] The program retries the write operation - [ ] The program ignores the error and continues - [ ] The program closes the file and continues # Opening a File in Write-Only Mode What happens if the file `outfile` cannot be opened for writing in the `main()` function? \u003e Explanation: If `open()` returns -1, indicating that the file could not be opened, the `fatal_error()` function is called to handle the error by printing a message and exiting. ```python int fdout = open(\"outfile\", O_WRONLY, 0); if (fdout == -1) fatal_error(\"can't open output file\"); ``` - [x] The program prints an error message and exits - [ ] The program opens the file in read-only mode instead - [ ] The program continues without writing to the file - [ ] The program waits for the file to become available # Opening a File for Writing What are the permissions assigned to the file `outfile` when it is opened with the following `open()` call? \u003e Explanation: The `0664` permission mode allows the owner to read and write, and the group to read. Others also have read permissions. ```python int fdout = open(\"outfile\", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT, 0664); ``` - [x] Owner has read and write, group has read, others have read permissions - [ ] Owner has read and write, group has write, others have no permissions - [ ] Owner and group have read and write, others have no permissions - [ ] Everyone has read and write permissions # Function of `write()` System Call What is the role of the `write()` system call inside the `str_write()` function? \u003e Explanation: The `write()` function attempts to write the specified number of bytes to the file descriptor and returns the number of bytes successfully written. ```python result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars); ``` - [x] It writes the remaining part of the string to the file and returns the number of bytes written - [ ] It reads data from the file - [ ] It closes the file - [ ] It appends the string to the end of the file # Handling Partial Writes Why does the `str_write()` function use a loop to call `write()` repeatedly? \u003e Explanation: The `write()` system call may write fewer bytes than requested, so the loop ensures that all the data is written by repeatedly calling `write()` with the remaining data. ```python for (;;) { result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars); if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error writing output file\"); if (result == 0) break; num_written += result; num_chars -= result; } ``` - [x] To ensure that all bytes are written, handling partial writes - [ ] To retry writing the file on failure - [ ] To keep reading data from the file - [ ] To check if the file is writable # Truncating a File What does the `O_TRUNC` flag do in the `open()` system call? \u003e Explanation: The `O_TRUNC` flag truncates the file, which means it clears all its content if the file already exists before writing new data. ```python int fdout = open(\"outfile\", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0664); ``` - [x] It clears the content of the file if it exists - [ ] It appends new data to the file - [ ] It prevents the file from being opened if it exists - [ ] It opens the file in read-only mode # Error Handling with `write()` What happens if the `write()` system call fails in the `str_write()` function? \u003e Explanation: If `write()` returns a negative value, the `fatal_error()` function is called, which prints an error message and terminates the program. ```python if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error writing output file\"); ``` - [x] The program prints an error message and exits - [ ] The program retries writing to the file - [ ] The program ignores the error and continues - [ ] The program closes the file and continues # Handling Partial Writes in C Why does the `str_write()` function contain a loop for calling `write()`? \u003e Explanation: The `write()` system call may write fewer bytes than requested, so the loop ensures that all the data is written by calling `write()` repeatedly until the entire string is written. ```python for (;;) { result = write(fd, buf + num_written, num_chars); if (result \u003c 0) fatal_error(\"error writing output file\"); if (result == 0) break; num_written += result; num_chars -= result; } ``` - [x] To handle partial writes and ensure all bytes are written - [ ] To keep appending data to the file - [ ] To retry writing if an error occurs - [ ] To ensure that the file is opened in write mode "
